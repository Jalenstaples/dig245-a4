           <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
<p>Greetings! I am a Davidson College student pursuing a degree in Communication Studies. Currently, I am spending my entire semester in San Francisco with the Liberal Arts in Silicon Valley program studying tech and other foundational skills that are essential in virtually all career paths.

            <h2>What You Should Know</h2>
<p>What motivates me to study such subjects is my desire to absorb as much diverse information as possible which will allow me to be a more well-rounded individual. With the increased growth of technology today and the grave importance of communication worldwide, I feel these areas of study are surely impactful to a future career in business and entrepreneurship. With that being said, another aspect of my motivation is my desire to become a successful businessman and entrepreneur in the near future. </p>

            <h2>Who to work with?</h2>

            <p>I would love to connect with individuals who have strong knowledge and experience in this field. Through being an athlete for almost my entire life, I am also intrigued by marketing/public relations, especially in the realm of sports and business organizations. Lastly, I'm very interested in learning more about what exactly it takes to start-up and run a successful business while also creating a lasting, positive impact on society. </p>
